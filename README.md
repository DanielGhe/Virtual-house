# Virtual-house
Creating a house with sensors using pure virtual functions.

Every room have 3 sensors: temperature, humidity and pressure. The user can create a house object, assign rooms to that house, then, for every room, a txt file is generated that will serve as a storage for sensors data.
The user can update the measurements, create/delete or show room data in console.
